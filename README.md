# It's Time to put the GraphQL into GraphDatabases

This thesis is all about how to effectivly use GraphQL together with graph databases such as Neo4J, ArrangoDB and others.

This thesis is writtin in Dutch.

How is the performance? 
Is it easily maintainable?
How is this implemented into a production worthy application?

These are the kind of question I'll be answering.

## Technologies
- Neo4J
- GraphQL Apollo Stack
- Node.JS backend

## Methodology
I'll start by setting up a simple Neo4J graph database and a simple backend running the GraphQL - Apollo stack. Once this works fine, I'll start increasing the size of the database. Once the Neo4J experiments are done, I'll switch to another graph database provider.

## Compilation
1. Clone this repository
